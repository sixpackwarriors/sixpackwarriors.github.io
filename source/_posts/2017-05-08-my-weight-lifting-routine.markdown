Hey Warriors,

One of the most common questions I'm asked when it comes to building muscle is:

> "What is your routine?"

So I thought I'd share with you guys **the staple routine that I follow 99% of the time** (I rarely switch up the routine, because if it ain't broke, don't fix it). This is exactly the routine that I followed to pack on 56 pounds of muscle during the first 10 months of my body transformation journey.

For each exercise, I perform 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Once I can perform 8 with perfect form and tempo, I increase the weight.

I cycle through these routines, with 1 rest day in between.

Here is what it looks like:

###Routine A - Legs, Chest, Biceps###

What's going on, warriors!

Today, I got an intense, 7 minute HIIT routine for you.

We’re doing these 3 movements:

Jump + Knee Tuck, Push Up + Mountain Climbers, Crunches

Don’t underestimate this routine though, because the Jump + Knee Tuck movement will tire you out quickly. Try to catch your breath quickly during the 15 second rest break, and sip on a bit of water as well.

More Importantly, for the Jump + Knee Tuck movement, make sure to land softly! Try to do this movement over a padded area like a yoga mat, or wear some shoes.

Always maintain proper form, and just try to keep moving, even if you are tired.

Enjoy the burn and the sweat!

**Total Time**: 7 minutes

**Movements**: Jump + Knee Tuck, Push Up + Mountain Climbers, High Knees

**Description**: Perform 4 rounds of the following series of exercises.

Just watch the demo video below, and get started today guys!

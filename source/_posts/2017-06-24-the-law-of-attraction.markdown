Hey warriors!

Those that know me personally often ask me how I repeatedly achieve success and constantly get what I want out of my life...

Like winning numerous piano competitions ever since I was a kid...

And landing my first internship, and subsequently my first gig, at a company that then repeatedly bumped up my salary over and over again by over 61% (not including equity compensation) in a matter of just two years...

Or waking up at 4:30 in the morning every other day to hit the gym and craft the body of my dreams before I head to my full time job...

To finding the time and energy to do those crazy HIIT routines that I've been sharing with you in our emails so that I can maintain my six pack abs...

And just recently, [I proposed to my fiancée](/blog/2017/06/24/she-said-yes/ "She Said Yes!"), who happily and immediately said yes to the next chapter of our lives...

When you take a look at those around you, you may seem to notice how certain people just continue to get what they want out of life, one thing after the other. It's almost as if they're completely unstoppable. It's almost as if nothing that you say or do can ever prevent them from their getting what they want. Like they have this fire, this passion, this force behind them that propels them to their goals. How is this possible? Is it even possible?

And the good news is yes, it absolutely is possible. You CAN achieve whatever you want in your life. As simple as it sounds, all you really need is to put your mind to it. The more you think about what you want, the more you think about the thoughts that will get you what you want in life, and the more you'll consciously, and more importantly, subconsciously do the things that will contribute to your reaching your end goal. 

I know I know...you're probably thinking that I'm full of shit right now with this psychological crap that am I spewing, right? That this "lifehack" is just so intangible and useless...

Well, you don't have to hear this "bullshit" from me. Just take a look at some of the world's greatest innovators...

Elon Musk and his dream of clean energy quickly allowed him to create the sexy Tesla car models, advanced solar shingles as roof tiles that look better and are more durable than existing roof tiles in your home, and much more...

Jeff Bezos and his long-term vision to take over the entire world, led to the numerous acquisitions throughout Amazon's existence, like the recent buyout of Whole Foods which has caused another huge influx of capital into the e-commerce market and an outflux of capital from physical retail and grocery stores.

It's almost like these people are able to somehow shape their mental vision into their reality. How?

Were they weren't struck by lightning?

Were they some kind of a godsend or some super genius?

No...quite the opposite.

These people simply operated under the phenomena called The Law of Attraction.

Simply put, the Law of Attraction states:

> ...you attract into your life those things, circumstances and conditions that correspond with the nature of your dominant, habitual thoughts and beliefs, both conscious and subconscious...

You see, the people that get what they want out of their lives never once stopped believing in their ability to get what they want. They constantly live and breathe their mission and their vision.

Every little decision that they make, every little action that they take, it all somehow contributes to the end goal that they want, whether they know it or not.

And now, it's your turn to do the same in your life.

Do you want that go on a date with that guy/girl you constantly see every day, but don't have the courage to ask them? Well, envision yourself with the courage, and just ask them the next time you see them!

Do you want to get those six pack abs that you've desired for so long? Well, do whatever it takes to shred off those layers of fat!

Do you want to level up in your career and start getting promoted? Well figure out what it takes to get to that next level and start imagining yourself operating at that higher position!

Finally, for today, I want you to ask yourself and answer these questions:

- What exactly do you want to achieve out of your life?
- What contribution do you want to make to our world?
- What kind of a legacy do you want to leave behind?

Let me know what your answers are by responding to me in this email, or by sharing your comment with our Six Pack Warriors community at the bottom of this relevant blog post.

Until next time, never stop believing in your ultimate success in anything that you want in life.

Your warrior companion,<br/>
Ken Yu

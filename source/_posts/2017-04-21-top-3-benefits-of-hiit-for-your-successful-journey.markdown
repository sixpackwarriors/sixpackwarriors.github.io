Hey, what's going on warriors!<br/>
<br/>
Today, I want to talk about 3 huge advantages that HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) has over steady-state cardio and how they will help you achieve success in your body transformation journey.<br/>
<br/>
If you are not already familiar with the fundamental difference between HIIT and steady-state cardio, make sure that you check out my post here first, before continuing on.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, let's get down to business.<br/>
<br/>
**1. HIIT Is Great For Your Heart**<br/>
<br/>
When you’re doing steady state cardio, quite often, you can’t push yourself to your maximum work rate because you need to make sure your session lasts a long time. However, with HIIT, since your sessions are much shorter, you actually can push yourself hard enough such that your heart rate reaches 85% to 100% of your maximum heart rate. Raising your heart rate via exercise is a great way to reduce cholesterol, lower the risk of heart disease, and greatly improves your cardiovascular system.


**2. HIIT Is Less Mentally Draining**

Which would you rather choose? 

60 minutes of jogging

OR...

10 minutes of HIIT

If you’re like most people, you would probably choose number 2. That makes sense. After all, 10 minutes of an activity that achieves more fat burn than 60 minutes of another is an incredible time saver.

But also, think about how mentally exhausting it is to consider doing 60 minutes of cardio. Just the thought of that makes ME extremely tired.

With shorter sessions, you become more motivated to power through your exercises and get on with the day. And when you’re more motivated, you’re more likely to stay consistent and achieve success in your journey.


**3. HIIT Is More Fun**

In steady-state cardio, you’re most likely just doing one motion over and over again at the same pace. There aren’t many variables, and you can easily get bored. If you find yourself pulling out a book and reading your favorite novel on the treadmill, then you’re already not going to make much progress, as you’re not even putting 100% of your focus on the workout.

In contrast, HIIT allows you to combine very different movements and exercises. You can easily create your own fun routines to do. Having a variety and mixing things up makes it much more engaging, and it makes it something that you can look forward to doing. And the more you do it, the more fat you'll burn!

If you’re still not convinced about all of the benefits of HIIT, just do a simple Google search on it and you’ll find a ton more info.

I'll see you in the next post.

Cheers!

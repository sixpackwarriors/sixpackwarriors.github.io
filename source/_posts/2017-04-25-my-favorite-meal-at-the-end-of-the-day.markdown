Hey warriors,

By now, I hope you've learned that when the day comes to a close, you should lower your calories, as your body is less active. One of the easiest ways to do that is by swapping out the starchy carbs with the fibrous carbs. This also keeps your insulin levels relatively low, resulting is less fat storage.

Today I want quickly share with you what *my* favorite meal looks like as the day comes to an end.

**This meal is really easy to make, takes less than 5 minutes of actual work, and burns your fat like crazy.**

So here's what you'll need:

- 3 oz. salmon filet (thawed)
- 1 red bell pepper
- A bunch of asparagus

Here's what the main ingredients look like:

</a>

*Instructions:*

1. Set the oven to broil, while bringing a pot of water to boil, enough to cover all of the asparagus.

2. Once the water starts boiling, throw in all of the asparagus, boil the asparagus for 1 minute, and then drain.

3. Wrap the salmon, asparagus, and bell peppers in foil, and then throw it into the oven. Broil for 12 minutes.

That's it. When the timer's done, take your foil pack out of the oven and serve on a plate. Feel free to garnish with whatever seasoning you like.

Here's what it should look like when it's all done:

Super easy, super clean, and super fat burning.

Enjoy this meal warriors.

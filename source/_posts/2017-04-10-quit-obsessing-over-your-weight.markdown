It's frustrating.<br/>
<br/>
One morning, you step on the scale and record your body weight for the day.<br/>
<br/>
The very next day, under the same circumstances, after following every meal and exercise routine you've planned, you step the on scale again, and guess what happens?<br/>
<br/>
You gain another five pounds.<br/>
<br/>
**WTF?** That number on the scale should be going down if you're doing everything correctly! Where is that extra weight coming from? What are you doing wrong?!

The wheels in your head start spinning...

Was it from the higher sodium content of the foods you ate yesterday, causing your body to retain more water than usual?

Was it because of the fluid retention from your menstrual cycle?

Or, was it because you've gained a bit of muscle throughout your body?

Maybe it was because the scale somehow got miscalibrated?

Or maybe there was even a blip in the earth's gravitational pull? Maybe I should step on the scale again...

You get the point. As you can see, there are just waaaaay too many factors that can affect the number on your scale. And unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to find out your exact weight.

**But that doesn't mean it's the end of the world.**

Keep in mind that your body transformation journey is about *changing the shape of your body.*

So ultimately, do you really care about the number on the scale? Or *do you care more about how your body looks?*

If you start your journey weighing 200 pounds, and two months later, you look in the mirror and you appear leaner and more muscular, but you haven't lost a single pound, are you really going to be frustrated that you just can't seem to get to 199 pounds?

Vice versa, if you start your journey weighing 200 pounds, and two months later, you're 190 pounds, but you look in the mirror and realize that you look even more flabby and less toned than you did before, are you really going to be happy that you lost those 10 pounds?

Bottom line is this: instead of obsessing over the number on the scale, start looking at your body in the mirror. Measure your body fat with calipers or simply pinch your belly fat with your fingers. If you feel like you have less fat than you did before, or if you feel like you look more toned and muscular, then that's what really matters!

Until then, continue envisioning the body that you want, keep doing the right things over and over, and enjoy the process! The results will come.

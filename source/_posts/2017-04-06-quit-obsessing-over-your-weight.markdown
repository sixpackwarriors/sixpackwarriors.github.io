It's frustrating. I get it.<br/>
<br/>
You step on the scale and jot down your body weight for the day.<br/>
<br/>
The very next day, under the same circumstances, and following everything that you've been told, you step the on scale again, and guess what happens?<br/>
<br/>
That's right, you gained another five pounds.

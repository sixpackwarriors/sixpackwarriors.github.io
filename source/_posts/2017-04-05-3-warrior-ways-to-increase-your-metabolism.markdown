When it comes to weight loss, one term gets thrown around quite often: *metabolism.*<br/>
<br/>
**Why is metabolism so important?**<br/>
<br/>
You probably already know that in order to lose weight, you need to be at a calorie deficit. And to be at a calorie deficit, you need to burn more calories than you consume.<br/>
<br/>
Well, one major way to burn more calories is by elevating your metabolism, which is the rate at which your body burns calories.

**So if you want to focus on burning calories, you need to focus on increasing your metabolism. Simple as that.**

Here, I'm going to cover the three most important ways you can increase your metabolism.

No, I'm not talking about eating tons of cayenne pepper or taking ice cold showers. That's for the amateurs.

I'm talking about real work. Yeah, that's right - the smart and efficient way. The warrior way.

So, let's get into it.

**1. Eat Smaller, Balanced Meals, More Frequently<br/>**
Eating more frequently in smaller meals not only helps curb your hunger, but when consumed with the proper macronutrients, it also helps keep your metabolism high. Your meals should consist of the correct macronutrient ratios - **it must contain lean proteins and complex carbs**.

In our body transformation book, if your goal is to maximize fat loss, we suggest that your macronutrient ratio should be 20% fat, 40% carbs, and 40% protein. If you are carb sensitive, you can also go with 20% fat, 35% carbs, and 45% protein.

If your body fat percentage is relatively low and if your goal is to maximize muscle growth, we suggest that your macronutrient ratio be 20% fat, 45% carbs, and 35% protein.

Make sure that you eat mostly lean proteins as your source of protein. This can be egg whites, chicken breast, turkey breast, any kind of white fish, or low fat dairy products.

For complex carbs, go with slow digesting carbs like oatmeal or brown rice. As always, include fibrous carbs (vegetables, beans) in the mix.

**2. Do HIIT<br/>**
HIIT, or High Intensity Interval Training, is a cardio technique that has been proven time and time again to be the most efficient way of burning fat.

In contrast to conventional, steady-state cardio, which burns calories only during the duration of your workout, **HIIT training elevates your metabolism for a prolonged duration, causing you to continue to burn more calories even after your workout.**

So don't just walk or jog on the treadmill all day, every day. Mix it up and incorporate some HIIT routines into your workout session. For a list of my favorite routines, check out my YouTube channel here. I guarantee you, an hour after your HIIT session, you will still be sweating!

**3. Build Muscle<br/>**
This is a bit more of a touchy subject for females, who may feel a bit scared about building muscle. After all, it may not seem attractive for a woman to want to "bulk up" and look like the Incredible Hulk.

Relax.

**Building muscle is actually not that easy for women.**

For starters, women naturally have higher estrogen levels and lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels make it much harder for women to actually gain as much muscle as fast as men can. Plus, the moment that you think you look too bulky, you can always cut down on the amount of weight that you lift.

**Having muscles also helps you shape your body!**

Muscles give your body definition. Imagine being skinny with a layer of fat without much muscle mass (AKA "skinny-fat"). While you may not look fat, you also don't look great, because your body's shape isn't backed by the muscles that you should have. If you want that toned, beach-body look, then you need to start going to the gym and lifting weights.

Lastly, and the most important part about building muscle, is that **having more muscle mass directly increases your metabolism.**

The more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism will be. And the higher your metabolism is, the more calories you burn!

Imagine your muscles as the fire logs in your fireplace. The more you have, the more you burn!

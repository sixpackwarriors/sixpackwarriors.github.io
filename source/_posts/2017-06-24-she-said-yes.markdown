Hey warriors!

I'm happy to announce that over this past week, I took a trip to Vancouver, where I proposed to my fiancee in the Butchart Gardens in Victoria:

I'm super grateful to have some of my friends there to capture this special moment, the beautiful weather that day, and how everything went according to plan.

Lastly, thank you all for your support, for being a part of the Six Pack Warriors family, and for allowing me to make a positive impact on your life.

Until next time, train hard warrior!

Your warrior companion,<br/>
Ken Yu

*P.S. Oh yeah, she said yes.*

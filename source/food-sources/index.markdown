Here are a list of my favorite food sources for you to choose from when you construct your meal plans.

Warriors who have *[Your Warrior Transformation](https://gumroad.com/l/ivVMS "Your Warrior Transformation eBook")* already have access to this list and can easily plan out their own meals.

Warriors in our community also know how to create their own fat burning meals.

To make it more convenient for you to create your own meals, I've created this list for you.

Have fun mixing and matching!

For example, some of your meals can look like this.

<strong>Sample Meal 1:</strong><br/>
<ul>
<li> 3 oz. salmon filet (lean protein + healthy fats)</li>
<li>1/2 cup brown rice (complex carbs) </li>
<li>1 cup spinach (fibrous carbs)  </li>
</ul>

<strong>Sample Meal 2:</strong><br/>
<ul>

<li>1/2 cup brown rice (complex carbs)  </li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It all started in the summer of 2010, during my freshman year in college.</p>

<p>I don’t exactly remember how it happened, but one day, I woke up with a little flame inside me and decided that I wanted these:</p>

</a></p>

<p>Who doesn’t, right? After all, six-pack abs basically turn heads anywhere.</p>

<p>As an engineer at heart, I was naturally drawn to scientific and systematic ways of doing things. So after some time googling around for how to get those abs, I had found a book that made sense to me and my body transformation desires:
<em><a href="http://amzn.to/2qbz82v" title="Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle">Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle</a></em> by Tom Venuto (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/book/burn-the-fat-feed-the-muscle/id708413335?mt=11" title="iBooks version">iBooks version</a>). From that moment on, my life would change forever.</p>

<p>I couldn’t put down the book. First of all, it completely took a massive dump on all of the fat burning myths, which are so pervasive in the “Fat Loss” industry — myths like the “lose 10 pounds of fat in 10 days” magazines that you see in the supermarket’s checkout counters, the “magic pill” that you take that makes you lose your appetite, those cleansing and fasting diets along with long, boring sessions of cardio, the unsustainable no carb/Atkins diets, you name it.</p>

<p>Instead, it went into the science behind why you can’t target fat loss (like trying to do countless crunches to get rid of belly fat), and that to really get rid of fat, you really just have to burn more calories than you’re taking in. Simple, yet often overlooked.</p>

<p>Then, Tom began talking about the technicalities of getting shredded — increasing muscle mass, employing HIIT, exploiting our body’s hormones at certain times, and receiving proper nutrition with tricks like carb-cycling. At this point, my engineering brain was hooked. I actually got so excited that I began opening up spreadsheets to plan out my meals and workouts while reading along.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Above all, the most important piece of advice that Tom gave in his book that made my transformation everlasting is the psychological aspect of his system. <strong>Achieving six-pack abs is no quick and easy solution, but rather a journey and process that takes time.</strong> The most effective way to achieve this goal and to make it last is by having not only the proper knowledge, but also a <strong>powerful mindset</strong>. That is, in order for me to transform my body forever, I must develop the mindset of a warrior in order to achieve this goal. And after reading the book, that little flame inside me turned into a bonfire. I began to believe so strongly, like a devout theist, that I would achieve that shredded look.</p>

<p>And I did, eventually. It took some time (more than most would be willing to wait for) and a lot of effort (more than most would be willing to put in when first starting out). Although the results didn’t come immediately, I stayed patient — I focused on the process and relentlessly followed the system: getting proper nutrition, logging my macros and workouts, rehearsing and practicing my routines mentally before heading to the gym, employing high intensity interval training and carb-cycling, and in general, finding a way to fit all of these little puzzle pieces into my existing lifestyle. </p>

<p>Gradually over time, the results came.</p>

<p>2 months later, I started to notice the small changes. I had achieved my 6 pack abs, but I was still pretty damn scrawny. So I decided that I wanted to bulk up and gain some muscle.</p>

<p>In the next 4 months, I trained heavily in the gym, while incorporating cardio into my workout routines.</p>

<p>Soon, I started noticing results. People around me started to see them, too.</p>

<p>In fact, those who said that I couldn’t do it started asking for advice.</p>

<p>I took all of these signals and fed them back into my system, creating a positive feedback loop that fueled more gains and helped me press the advantage.</p>

<p>Over the course of the following 6 months, I would then go on to <strong>gain over 56 pounds of muscle mass while maintaining my 6 pack abs.</strong></p>

<p>And by the 12th month of my body transformation journey, I had achieved what they call the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bodybuildingweightprogram.com/golden-ratio/" title="Adonis Golden Ratio">Adonis Golden Ratio</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Visually, here&rsquo;s my before and after:</p>

</a></p>

<p>Did I stop there? Absolutely not. To this day (almost 7 years later), I continue to polish my craft, from bulking up and leaning down, to planning around those curveballs that life throws at me every now and then. It’s a never-ending journey, and there is always room to improve.</p>

<p>The best part about my journey is that the positive feedback never stops coming. Those who know me personally call me crazy for waking up at 4:30 in the morning to hit the gym before heading work. And just the other day, I bumped into an old high school friend who was shocked when she saw me, as she had remembered me as a scrawny kid, but was now calling me “swole.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, bodybuilding has become a vital part of me and manifests itself beyond the bounds of the gym. In fact, it has become my platform and foundation for almost every aspect in my life — <strong>I apply the same principles of bodybuilding to those areas in which I aim to achieve success in.</strong></p>

<p>There’s a saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Your mind is the athlete. Your body is just the tool.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really do believe that. Whatever goal it is that you want to achieve in life, you must start by believing that you will achieve it. Then, continuously build strong thoughts around that goal. Most importantly, take action by focusing on the process, and the results will naturally come.</p>

<p>Cheers guys!</p>

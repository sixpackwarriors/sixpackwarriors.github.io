    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey Warriors!</p>

<p>Not all complex carbohydrates are created equal. Understanding the differences between the two classes of complex carbohydrates will help you know when you should be eating one over the other.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by diving into the first main complex carbohydrate: <strong>starchy carbs.</strong></p>

<h3>Starchy Carbs</h3>

<p>Starchy carbs are carbs that contain high starch content. These are things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>bread</li>
<li>cereal</li>
<li>corn</li>
<li>oats</li>
<li>peas</li>
<li>rice</li>
</ul>


<p>For a more complete list of starchy carbs, check out <a href="/food-sources/" title="Food Sources List">this resource here</a>.</p>

<p>Starchy carbs are a great source of energy. When your body is active, you want to make sure that you properly nourish it with starchy carbs. Starchy carbs are able to raise your blood sugar levels, and thus, insulin levels, to help your cells absorb the sugars for energy.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s highly unlikely that your body is always extremely active. In fact, when the day comes to a close, your body begins winding down, getting ready for relaxation. Your metabolism slows down, and your body&rsquo;s hormones become more sensitive to blood sugar levels.</p>

<p>During these times, it&rsquo;s important that we make sure to NOT create a high insulin response, something we usually get when we eat starchy carbs (<a href="/blog/2017/04/29/you-dont-have-to-eliminate-carbs/" title="Insulin Effect">remember that a high insulin response will actually cause the cells in our body to store the food in our body as fat</a>).</p>

<p>So does that mean that we just can&rsquo;t eat carbs at night?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. In fact, there&rsquo;s another type of complex carbohydrate that you <em>should</em> eat at night in order to avoid creating a rapid insulin spike: <strong>fibrous carbs.</strong></p>

<h3>Fibrous Carbs</h3>

<p>Fibrous carbs are carbs that contain a lot of dietary fiber. These are things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>vegetables</li>
<li>nuts</li>
<li>beans</li>
<li>certain fruits</li>
</ul>


<p>For a more complete list of fibrous carbs, check out <a href="/food-sources/" title="Food Sources List">this resource here</a>.</p>

<p>Fibrous carbs are a great source of replacement for starchy carbs as the day comes to a close. Because of their low GI score, they are recommended as one of the best foods to eat to maintain a slow, steady insulin response. Thus, it makes sense that if you want to help your body avoid storing fat, especially when its sensitive to carbs at night, that you swap out the starchy carbs with the fibrous carbs.</p>

<p>The other benefit of fibrous carbs is that it makes you feel extremely full due to its high fiber content. In fact, most fibrous carbs usually contain very few calories, so you can eat a lot, feel really full, and still be able to taper your calories to match your body&rsquo;s energy expenditure requirements at the end of the day.</p>

<h3>The Takeaway</h3>

<p>Understanding these two different types of complex carbohydrates will help you know when to feed your body the right types of carbs, depending on your activity level.</p>

<p>Just remember these two important points:</p>

<ul>
<li>During the times of your day when your body is active, consume meals that contain mostly starchy carbs, coupled with some servings of fibrous carbs.</li>
<li>During the times of your day when your body is not active (ie. towards night time), replace all starchy carbs with fibrous carbs.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you include these two rules into your meal plan while meeting your calorie targets, you will notice immense differences in the shape of your body.</p>

<p>I look forward to your progress. Until next time, train hard, and enjoy your meals. Cheers!</p>

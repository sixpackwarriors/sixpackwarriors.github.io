    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most peculiar things that I discovered throughout my body transformation journey was this:<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I go out drinking the night before, drink a bit more than I should, and wake up the next day with a big hangover, for some weird reason&hellip;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The hangover completely dissipates after I work out.</strong><br/>
<br/>
It&rsquo;s very counterintuitive, because usually when we are hungover, all we want to do is lie around in bed and rest up. We feel dizzy, weak, and maybe even nauseous. So naturally, we feel like all we can do is vegetate.</p>

<p>But friends, that&rsquo;s the beauty of thinking like a warrior. Even on the days when I&rsquo;m hungover, I still drag my ass out of the bed and hit the gym with my utmost focus and concentration. And the beautiful thing is, by the time I come home, my hangover just magically goes away.</p>

<p>As I think more and more about this, I realize that it makes perfect sense. By working out, we increase our metabolism, and thus, we increase our cells' processes. This means our body is able to flush the toxins out of our body much more quickly. Hangover? Gone.</p>

<p>See what happens when you think like a warrior?</p>

<p>And as I&rsquo;m getting older and older, this trick becomes more and more important, because my body&rsquo;s ability to metabolize alcohol weakens, and no matter how much water I drink to try to flush the alcohol out of my system, it just never seems to be enough. I&rsquo;d be pissing clear fluids, and my head would still feel dizzy.</p>

<p>So, throughout the years, from this discovery, I&rsquo;m going to share with you what I believe is the most efficient hangover cure that you should have in your journey as a warrior.</p>

<p>With that said, here is my 10 minute workout that will completely get rid of your hangover, guaranteed. Get ready guys, because it&rsquo;s going to be some intense high intensity interval training.</p>

<p>Here we go:</p>

<p><strong>Total time: 10 minutes</strong></p>

<p>Perform these exercises for 45 seconds straight, then take a 15 second rest. Repeat at least 10 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Burpee With Push Up → 6 Mountain Climbers → 6 Jumping Lunges (Repeat for 45 seconds)</li>
<li>Rest (for 15 seconds)</li>
</ul>


<p>Try this out guys. I promise, if you ever wake up with a hangover, this is the best way you can get rid of it and get on with your day.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>
Ken</p>

    <link href="http://sixpackwarriors.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/stop-dieting/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-05T21:55:36-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sixpackwarriors.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/stop-dieting</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you or people you know claimed that they&rsquo;re starting a new diet, only to hear something like this:<br/><br/></p>

<blockquote><p>“This time, I&rsquo;m going to stick to my diet! No more carbs! I&rsquo;m going to cut them out completely for good and only eat 1000 calories a day.”</p></blockquote>

<p><br/>or<br/>
<br/></p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hey, check out this new apple vinegar cider that I&rsquo;m drinking every day. It&rsquo;s helped me lose so much weight, and I barely have to do anything!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Probably way too often. And it&rsquo;s not their fault. Through technology and clever marketing tactics, diets like Paleo or Atkins, fat-burning supplements, and detox or cleansing diet fads have all caused a significant amount of noise and influenced the masses in an instant. “Lose 20 pounds in 10 days,” they say. Wow! Who wouldn&rsquo;t want the quick and easy fix?</p>

<p>In the world today, people tend to migrate towards the quick and easy solution to achieving the results that they want. Just take a quick look at your surroundings. How much of the technology around you was built to make your life easier so that you don&rsquo;t have to do anything anymore?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these quick-fix solutions are often times not scalable, and when it comes to your health, it&rsquo;s simply not worth risking the unknown side effects. Remember that Rome was not built in a day, and neither should your weight loss journey be.</p>

<p>Take a moment to think about the shortcuts around you in life. Have you ever tried taking shortcuts to achieving what you wanted?</p>

<p>For example, how many people do you know who have illegally taken the HOV lane to beat traffic, only to get pulled over eventually by law enforcement?</p>

<p>If that concept is not clear enough, then imagine taking the stairs down from the top of a building without an elevator, and then imagine taking the shortcut - jumping off of the building. Which method do you think creates long-lasting results?</p>

<p>The same idea can be applied to shortcuts in weight loss. You may get the quick results that you seek by taking some magic pill or cutting out carbs completely, but over time, this solution won&rsquo;t scale. Eventually, when you snap back to reality, you’ll just gain back all of the weight that you&rsquo;ve lost, and then some, or even worse, permanently damage your body from the side effects of the supplements you took. Then, if you still have the chance, you&rsquo;ll have to start all over again, hopefully the right way next time. As John Wooden once said:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Bottom line - if you want something, you have to work for it. Especially when it comes to your health, shortcuts are simply not worth the risk. That kind of a &ldquo;diet&rdquo; is not the lifestyle that you can afford to sustain.</strong></p>

<p>With that said, understand that only a part of your body transformation journey requires you to obtain the necessary information regarding nutrition and exercise, and harness this knowledge to construct a system that fits your lifestyle.</p>

<p>The bulk of your efforts throughout your journey requires you to actually execute upon your plan diligently with your utmost warrior mentality. You need to push yourself to do the things that you need to do, even when your mind is holding you back, begging you not to change, or dying for the easy way out. You need to short-circuit the limiting beliefs which exist in your mind, and you need to ignite the beliefs that you can and that you will. This is the warrior lifestyle.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to get off the amateur diet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to quit being average.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to do it the right way.</p>

<p><strong>Start building the foundation of your transformation by developing a strong mindset. Then, take everything you learned, and use your warrior mentality to transform your body.</strong></p>

    <link href="http://sixpackwarriors.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/3-warrior-ways-to-increase-your-metabolism/"/>
    <updated>2017-04-05T20:06:53-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sixpackwarriors.github.io/blog/2017/04/05/3-warrior-ways-to-increase-your-metabolism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to weight loss, one term gets thrown around quite often: <em>metabolism.</em><br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why is metabolism so important?</strong><br/>
<br/>
You probably already know that in order to lose weight, you need to be at a calorie deficit. And to be at a calorie deficit, you need to burn more calories than you consume.<br/>
<br/>
Well, one major way to burn more calories is by elevating your metabolism, which is the rate at which your body burns calories.</p>

<p><strong>So if you want to focus on burning calories, you need to focus on increasing your metabolism. Simple as that.</strong></p>

<p>Here, I&rsquo;m going to cover the three most important ways you can increase your metabolism.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m not talking about eating tons of cayenne pepper or taking ice cold showers. That&rsquo;s for the amateurs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about real work. Yeah, that&rsquo;s right - the smart and efficient way. The warrior way.</p>

<p>So, let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<p><strong>1. Eat Smaller, Balanced Meals, More Frequently<br/></strong>
Eating more frequently in smaller meals not only helps curb your hunger, but when consumed with the proper macronutrients, it also helps keep your metabolism high. Your meals should consist of the correct macronutrient ratios - <strong>it must contain lean proteins and complex carbs</strong>.</p>

<p>In our body transformation book, if your goal is to maximize fat loss, we suggest that your macronutrient ratio should be 20% fat, 40% carbs, and 40% protein. If you are carb sensitive, you can also go with 20% fat, 35% carbs, and 45% protein.</p>

<p>If your body fat percentage is relatively low and if your goal is to maximize muscle growth, we suggest that your macronutrient ratio be 20% fat, 45% carbs, and 35% protein.</p>

<p>Make sure that you eat mostly lean proteins as your source of protein. This can be egg whites, chicken breast, turkey breast, any kind of white fish, or low fat dairy products.</p>

<p>For complex carbs, go with slow digesting carbs like oatmeal or brown rice. As always, include fibrous carbs (vegetables, beans) in the mix.</p>

<p><strong>2. Do HIIT<br/></strong>
HIIT, or High Intensity Interval Training, is a cardio technique that has been proven time and time again to be the most efficient way of burning fat.</p>

<p>In contrast to conventional, steady-state cardio, which burns calories only during the duration of your workout, <strong>HIIT training elevates your metabolism for a prolonged duration, causing you to continue to burn more calories even after your workout.</strong></p>

<p>So don&rsquo;t just walk or jog on the treadmill all day, every day. Mix it up and incorporate some HIIT routines into your workout session. For a list of my favorite routines, check out my YouTube channel here. I guarantee you, an hour after your HIIT session, you will still be sweating!</p>

<p><strong>3. Build Muscle<br/></strong>
This is a bit more of a touchy subject for females, who may feel a bit scared about building muscle. After all, it may not seem attractive for a woman to want to &ldquo;bulk up&rdquo; and look like the Incredible Hulk.</p>

<iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/copwHGtEBC2Yg" width="480" height="265.18950437317784" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Relax.</p>

<p><strong>Building muscle is actually not that easy for women.</strong></p>

<p>For starters, women naturally have higher estrogen levels and lower testosterone levels. Lower testosterone levels make it much harder for women to actually gain as much muscle as fast as men can. Plus, the moment that you think you look too bulky, you can always cut down on the amount of weight that you lift.</p>

<p><strong>Having muscles also helps you shape your body!</strong></p>

<p>Muscles give your body definition. Imagine being skinny with a layer of fat without much muscle mass (AKA &ldquo;skinny-fat&rdquo;). While you may not look fat, you also don&rsquo;t look great, because your body&rsquo;s shape isn&rsquo;t backed by the muscles that you should have. If you want that toned, beach-body look, then you need to start going to the gym and lifting weights.</p>

<p>Lastly, and the most important part about building muscle, is that <strong>having more muscle mass directly increases your metabolism.</strong></p>

<p>The more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism will be. And the higher your metabolism is, the more calories you burn!</p>

<p>Imagine your muscles as the fire logs in your fireplace. The more you have, the more you burn!</p>

<blockquote><p>Imagine your muscles as the fire logs in your fireplace. <br/>The more you have, the more you burn.</p></blockquote>

<p>So there you have it, my top 3 tips to helping you increase your metabolism. Go ahead and start incorporating these tips into your routines if you haven&rsquo;t already. And again, for information on how you can incorporate these into your personalized body transformation system, check out my eBook <em><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/ivVMS" title="Your Warrior Transformation eBook">Your Warrior Transformation</a></em>.</p>
